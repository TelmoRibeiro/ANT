% PROJECT STATEMENT BY PROF. PRIOR %
The project aims to demonstrate the use of \textit{XDP} in Linux to accelerate packet processing and filtering while analyzing its performance.
% PROJECT EXTERNAL STRUCTURE %
The project is divided in two parts, the \textit{feasibility stage} and the \textit{implementation stage}.
The current iteration pertains to the first stage where the objectives, environment and the initial findings are stated.
% THE TECHNOLOGY %
\textit{eXpress Data Path (XDP)} is present in the Linux ecosystem since its 4.8 version. 
A technology that leverages \textit{extended Berkeley Packet Filter(eBPF)} to execute a finer and faster control on packet processing. 
Traditional packet processing methods struggle to mitigate latency and offer suboptimal performance,\textit{XDP} addresses these problems through processing in earlier layers on network stack.
